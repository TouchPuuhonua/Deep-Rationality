* What's Urgent?

This document is a work in progress - would you like to help?

** What Is Both Important And Urgent?

Two common ways of blowing the big stuff:
1. Being in action on what seems urgent but isn't what we really care about
2. Not being in action because of uncertainty, fear, stress, etc.
       - Hint: Self-Shaming is a key part of the meme complex which keeps us out
         of action!

** Being in Action Rationally

1. Find out what's important to you!
       - This is [[https://github.com/TouchPuuhonua/Deep-Rationality#readme][Deep Rationality]]
       - If this seems too woo-woo, maybe revisit it later?
2. Find out what's really going on in that area
       - Long-term dysfunction is usually being maintained by some active process!
       - Be an open-minded skeptic!

** Urgent for Whom?  - Circles of Concern

Who or what do we care about?

We can organize this into Circles of Concern.  From smallest to largest:
- Who or what I care about
      - myself right now
            - my immediate desires
      - my future
            - my aspirations for the quality of my life
      - people I know who I care about
            - family, friends, etc.
      - people I approve of
            - people who share my values
            - people who exhibit virtual as I see such
      - all human beings, or maybe
      - all sentient and sapient beings
            - which have an inner life
            - including minds, loves and aspirations for the future
      - all sentient beings
            - which can experience lives of varying quality
            - including the ability to suffer or experience well-being
      - life in general or maybe
      - healthy ecosystems

*** What We Need vs. What We Want

It's easy to confuse
- What we want as a fundamental value or need
      - e.g. freedom, expressing love, making a difference to others, etc.
- What we want as a strategy for meeting our values or needs
      - a lucrative job, an investment portfolio, etc.
      - membership in elite clubs and organizations
      - people who do what we tell them to do
      - etc.
