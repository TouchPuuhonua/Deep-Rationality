* Deep Rationality

A [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Devel/creating-curricula.org][Curriculum]] of the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel#readme][League of Extraordinary Learners]].

** Distinctions of Traditional Rationality

The distinctions of /Rationality/ are extremely valuable
- Using valid reasoning about important issues
- Detecting Accidental and Malicious Fallacies
- and so forth

Rationality provides tools for determining if a reasoning process is valid or
invalid and whether, given a degree of confidence in the truth of the premises,
what degree of confidence would be justified in the conclusions.

Study of Rationality and Mathematical Logic which it is based on will reveal
that there's nothing in either which can help us find or form
- our goals
- our values
- our life purpose

The studying of Rationality is directed by our intellect with an awareness of
our emotions.  It is about the /integrity of our thinking/.

** Distinctions of Deep Rationality

/Deep Rationality/ is directed by our /Being/. Deep Rationality is a process of
noticing the ways in which /Who We Are Being/ has been captured by /Belief
Systems/ and other /Attachments/. Deep Rationality is a practice of noticing
that those /Attachments/ are mental content which has nothing to do with our
/Authentic Self/.

Said in a simpler way, Deep Rationality is a practice of naturally shedding
attachments by observing those attachments while standing in our /Authentic
Self/.

Deep Rationality is grounded in Being. Being exists only in the moment. Being is
at the root of our life. When our attention is on the content of our life, we
can easily lose awareness of what it's like to be who we're being in the present
moment, we can easily lose awareness of what is determining the quality of our
being.

Deep Rationality tools are designed to allow us to
- free our attention somewhat from
      - what we're doing
      - our thoughts
      - our feeling
- have some distance between
      - the processes going on in our body and our mind
      - allowing us to notice what it's like
            - to be present to those processes
            - to be present to ourselves
- can notice any attachments coloring the quality of who we're being

Deep Rationality is an access to clarity, authenticity and integrity of being.

When we are present to our authentic self, we have the power to
- notice our values
- create goals which are congruent with our values
- authentically change and discard goals which do not serve us
- discover/create our life purpose

*** Spiritual Communities

Many spiritual communities have developed profound and effective tools for
accessing and practicing Deep Rationality. Alas, many of these traditions have
also collapsed some of their Deep Rationality distinctions with belief systems
and/or authoritarian practices over time. Collapsed distinctions can be
confusing, especially for those who have not practiced Deep Rationality outside
of such traditions.

Those of us who have a strong practice of Deep Rationality free of spiritual
traditions may discover that such traditions offer great treasure. Of especial
note are
- Many forms of Buddhism, especially Zen Buddhism
- Taoism
- Sufism, distinct from other forms of Islam

A good test for whether a system of Deep Rationality is free of excessive
attachments is to see if it is consistent with regular Rationality, Scientific
Inquiry and the values of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment][The European Enlightenment]], the sources of so much of
the freedom and awesomeness of the modern world.
