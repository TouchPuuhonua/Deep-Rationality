* Deep Rationality

A [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Devel/creating-curricula.org][Curriculum]] of /LOEL/, the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel#readme][League of Extraordinary Learners]].

We recommend reading this document slowly
- A few sections at a time
- Pause, reflect, take notes, share with others
- Explore some of the

- Then come back for more!

** What Deep Rationality Offers

- Freedom :: from attachments based on past upsets.

- Clarity :: to discover what really matters to us.

- Possibilities :: for inventing inspiring futures to live towards.

** What Deep Rationality Doesn't Offer

Training in Valid Reasoning

/BUT:/

Rationality and Deep Rationality very work well together
- despite being logically distinct!

- At the Logical Level :: Irrationality can lead to us making mistakes
  about our understanding of the world and our strategies for meeting
  our goals.

- At the Deeper Level :: Irrationality can lead us to fundamentally
  misunderstand ourselves and our values.
  - Beliefs are even more of an issue at this deeper level
  - they become connected with our identity and we hide them from ourselves.
  - Contradictions to our beliefs strengthen their grip!
    - And cause us to avoid looking at them critically!

** Fundamental Deep Rationality Distinctions

/Deep Rationality/ consists of distinctions that are
- of primary importance to all human beings
- poorly addressed by mainstream culture and education
- presented in confused forms by most religious and spiritual teachings
- addressed in sophisticated forms by specialized philosophers
      - who use specialized academic language
- therefore: Not very accessible to most human beings!

The primary experience of all Human Beings is /Subjective/, not /Objective/
- Our existence in the world has an immediate quality
      - /What it's like to be us/ is immediately experienced
      - [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_problem_of_consciousness][that's hard to explain!]]

We learn to interpret much of what we experience as being about
- /Objects In The World/ - /Things!/
- We learn to parse Sensory Experience into Objects!
We identify Objects:
- where they are, separate from other Objects
- what state they are in
  - the properties that shouldn't change
  - the properties which change, and how

It's easy to make the mistake of
- Interpreting Ourselves as just another /Object In The World/.
- Our Body and our Mind as (separate!) Objects!
- Containing more Objects "inside"
  - including our Thoughts and Feelings!

Why is this a mistake?
- We are what is doing the interpretation
- The interpretations we create are models
- /A map is not the territory it describes!/

Than what are we?
- We are /Subjects/ rather than /Objects/
- We are the /Source/ of our /Interpretations/
- We are the /Context/ witnessing and interpreting the /Content/
- We are Human /Beings/ experiencing
      - the Quality of /Being in the World/ along Evolving Time

Thoughts and Feelings have /no natural persistence!/
- No more than images in the eye or sounds in the ear!
- Appearances of persistence are actually reactivations
  - Which take active work on the part of the brain/mind!
- If you stop /giving attention/ to any thought or feeling
  - It will almost immediately disappear!

More details on this in the section on /Memes/ below.

** So What? - Briefly

What's wrong with identifying ourselves as an Object?

An Object is defined by its
- stable characteristics,
- known properties whose values change in limited ways.

Objects don't have any inherent meaning, purpose or dignity.

Subjects have
- A Quality of Being
  - What it's like to Be Themselves.
  - An Authentic Self!

Subjects are always and naturally
- Creating Interpretations!
- Creating and Discovering Meaning!

When we are present to our authentic self, we have the power to
- Notice our values
- Create goals which are congruent with our values
- Authentically discard or change goals
- Discover/Create our life purpose!

** So What? - At Greater Length

When we model a Human Being as an Object
- They become a stereotype
- We interpret them as being limited
- We create an illusion of predictability
- We lose the richness of their full being

When we model ourselves as an Object
- We become a stereotype to ourselves
- We interpret ourselves as being limited
- We expect our future to be consistent with our past
- (We may experience being trapped!)
- We lose the richness of our full being
- We lose the ability to /Create New Futures!/

Experiencing our immediate quality of Being
- Is fresh, energizing
- Cuts through our objectifications
- Reveals where we've become trapped by attachments

Buddhism identifies the source of suffering as Attachment
- to our interpretations
- to our points of view
- to our thoughts and feelings
- to Belief Systems
- to any Content

Attachments turn us into Objects.

Key practices of Deep Rationality are
- Noticing constraints in the Quality of our Being
- Identifying attachments
- Letting go of those attachments
- Engaging with our new freedom of being
- Rediscovering our /Authentic Self/

Shared Belief Systems can be difficult to distinguish
- They seem to just be "how reality is"
- (This is how superstitions operate!)
- Diversity in our community can be very helpful!
- Exposing ourselves to the new can be very helpful!

Deep Rationality is grounded in Being.
- Being exists only in the moment.
- Being is at the root of our life.

Much of our time we have our attention on the content of our life
- We easily lose awareness of /How We're Being/.
- Of the quality of being who we are in this moment.
- We forget who we are
- We unintentionally undermine the quality of our life
- We may feel like somethings off, something important is missing

Deep Rationality tools are designed to allow us to periodically
- Free our attention somewhat from
      - what we're doing
      - our thoughts
      - our feeling
- Create some distance between
      - the processes going on in our body and our mind
      - allowing us to notice what it's like
            - to be present to those processes
            - to be present to ourselves
- Notice any attachments coloring the quality of who we're being

Deep Rationality is an access to
- Clarity
- Authenticity
- Integrity of Being

** Culture and Memes Own You!

Cultures largely consist of
- vast overlapping and nested collections of memes!

We are social animals with language
- We have co-evolved with memes!
We human beings have slowly evolved
- to enhance our receptiveness to being colonized by networks of memes!
The Networks of Memes rapidly evolve
- to enhance their ability to colonize us!

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme][Memes]] are the smallest units of meaning
- which can be transmitted from one person to another
- typically by human language, but also by
  -  music, art, behavior, etc.
Most memes make little impression on us
- most are not retained very long, if at all!
Some memes profoundly change the entire direction of our life!

Memes replicate by being transmitted.
- Errors in transmission cause variations.
- Memes live in our limited memory resources
  - Which are controlled by our attention!
- Memes compete for
  - Holding your attention
  - Staying in your Working Memory
  - Getting stored in your Long-Term Memory
    - With triggers for reactivation
The resources are limited
- Fitter memes displace less fit memes!
- Does this start to sound familiar?

Memes
- replicators
- with mutate
and are therefore
- subject to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection][Natural Selection]]
  - much like genes are.
This was first explained  by the evolutionary biologist
-  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins][Richard Dawkins]] and
in a chapter of his enlightening little book
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Selfish_Gene][The Selfish Gene]].

Genetic Evolution and Memetic Evolution have different time scales
- Significant Genetic evolution takes millions of years
- Significant Memetic evolution can occur in weeks or months!
Yet the two are tightly coupled!
- The human mind emerges in part from a partnership
  - The human brain containing a vast network of memes
  - The mind containing the memes currently reactivated.
  - Yes, there's more, e.g. Consciousness
       - which no one understands very well!
       - but it has a lot to do with attention
       - which gives activated memes temporary persistence

/An aside:/

Many otherwise rational people who hold /[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism][Progressive]] Beliefs/ - as
distinct from /Progressive Values/ - consider [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Dawkins][Richard Dawkins]] and
especially his book /The Selfish Gene/ to be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anathema][Anathema]].  This is a
great example of how belief systems can undermine our integrity and
values.  Many rational thinkers with good values and important ideas
have been subject to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cancel_culture][Cancel Culture]] by people who claim to be
progressive.  People who entangle their beliefs with their personal
and social identities become enemies of their own needs and values!

/Back to memes:/

Memes do not act on their own!
- Any more than words in a sentence are acting on their own.
Memes form coalitions - memetic support networks
- in order to more efficiently acquire your brain's (and mind's) resources
- again like genes which do something analogous
How do memes convince your brain/mind to
- Store them in long-term memory
- Reactivate them on appropriate triggers
- Persist them for awhile in your Active Memory?
Memes attach themselves to your
- [[file:nvc-feelings-and-needs-inventory.pdf][Fundamental Human Feelings And Needs]]
- See the section on NVC in the [[file:RESOURCES.org][Resources]]!

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindfulness][Mindfulness Meditation]] is very useful to observing the memes and meme
coalitions which have colonized us and how they effect us.

** [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Know_thyself][Know Thyself]]

Your body (including your mind) is your vehicle in this life.
- It has a particular design with
  - needs, drives, emotions
  - sexual and gender orientations
  - cognitive quirks and limitations
  - intelligence, biases and much more!

What relationship with your body and your mind will support your
- Power, Freedom and Authenticity?

What Practices and Resources will allow you to actualize these
Possibilities?
