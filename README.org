* Deep Rationality

A [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel/blob/main/Devel/creating-curricula.org][Curriculum]] of /LOEL/, the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/loel#readme][League of Extraordinary Learners]].

We recommend reading this document slowly, a few sections at a time.
Pause, reflect, browse resources, come back for more.

** What Deep Rationality Offers

Deep Rationality offers
- freedom from attachments based on past upsets
- clarity to discover what really matters to us
- the possibility of inventing inspiring futures to live towards

** What Deep Rationality Doesn't Offer
- Training in Valid Reasoning
- for this see the [[https://github.com/GregDavidson/DATDA#readme][LOEL Curriculum on Rationality]]

Rationality and Deep Rationality work well together, despite being quite
distinct.

** Fundamental Deep Rationality Distinctions

/Deep Rationality/ is directed by distinctions that are
- of primary importance to all human beings
- poorly addressed by mainstream culture and education
- presented in confused forms by most religious and spiritual teachings
- addressed in sophisticated forms by specialized philosophers
      - who use specialized academic language
- therefore: Not very accessible to most human beings!

The primary experience of all Human Beings is /Subjective/, not /Objective/
- Our existence in the world has an immediate quality
      - /What it's like to be us/ is immediately experienced
      - that's hard to explain

We learn to interpret much of what we experience as being about
- /Entities In The World/
      - sensory experiences help us parse the world into /objects/
      - we identify
            - the presence of those objects
            - their stable characteristics
            - their current situation and changeable properties
- /Ourselves/
      - our body - much like other /objects in the world/
      - our thoughts and feelings

It's easy to make the mistake of
- interpreting ourselves as just another object in the world
- with stable characteristics, e.g. our body and mental machinery
- with properties, including our thoughts and feelings

Why is this a mistake?
- We are what is doing the interpretation
- The interpretations we create are models
- /A map is not the territory it described!/

Than what are we?
- We are /Subjects/ rather than /Objects/
- We are the /Source/ of our /Interpretations/
- We are the /Context/ witnessing and interpreting the /Content/
- We are Human /Beings/ experiencing
      - the Quality of /Being in the World/ along Evolving Time

** So What? - Briefly

What's wrong with identifying ourselves as an Object?

An Object is defined by its
- stable characteristics
- known properties whose values change in limited ways

Objects don't have any inherent meaning, purpose or dignity

Subjects have
- a Quality of Being
- what it's like to Be Themselves
- an Authentic Self

Subjects are always and naturally
- Creating Interpretations
- Creating and Discovering Meaning

When we are present to our authentic self, we have the power to
- notice our values
- create goals which are congruent with our values
- authentically discard or change goals
- discover/create our life purpose

** So What? - At Greater Length

When we model a Human Being as an Object
- they become a stereotype
- we interpret them as being limited
- we create an illusion of predictability
- we lose the richness of their full being

When we model ourselves as an Object
- we become a stereotype to ourselves
- we interpret ourselves as being limited
- we expect our future to be consistent with our past
- (we may experience being trapped!)
- we lose the richness of our full being
- we lose the ability to /Create New Futures!/

Experiencing our immediate quality of Being
- is fresh, energizing
- cuts through our objectifications
- reveals where we've become trapped by attachments

Buddhism identifies the source of suffering as Attachment
- to our interpretations
- to our points of view
- to our thoughts and feelings
- to Belief Systems
- to any Content

Attachments turn us into Objects.

Key practices of Deep Rationality are
- noticing constraints in the Quality of our Being
- identifying attachments
- letting go of those attachments
- engaging with our new freedom of being
- rediscovering our /Authentic Self/

Shared Belief Systems can be difficult to distinguish
- they seem to just be "how reality is"
- (This is how superstitions operate!)
- Diversity in our community can be very helpful!
- Exposing ourselves to the new can be very helpful!

Deep Rationality is grounded in Being.
- Being exists only in the moment.
- Being is at the root of our life.

Much of our time we have our attention on the content of our life
- We easily lose awareness of /How We're Being/.
- Of the quality of being who we are in this moment.
- We forget who we are
- We unintentionally undermine the quality of our life
- We may feel like somethings off, something important is missing

Deep Rationality tools are designed to allow us to periodically
- free our attention somewhat from
      - what we're doing
      - our thoughts
      - our feeling
- create some distance between
      - the processes going on in our body and our mind
      - allowing us to notice what it's like
            - to be present to those processes
            - to be present to ourselves
- notice any attachments coloring the quality of who we're being

Deep Rationality is an access to
- clarity
- authenticity
- integrity of being

** Deep Rationality Resources

Some LOEL creators offer [[https://touchpuuhonua.github.io/SomeClues/][Some Clues For You]]!

*** Books, Audio Recordings, Videos

Books make it easier for you as the Reader to pause and reflect.  Deep
Rationality books should usually be read slowly, a few pages or
sections at a time.  Audio Recordings and Videos are more immersive
but make it harder for you to reflect - this can be good as well as
bad!

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_by_Alan_Watts][Books and Audio Recordings of Alan Watts]]
- a treasure of Deep Rationality
- Alan Watts has made much of South and East Asian Deep Rationality
  accessible to everyone

*Nonviolent (Compassionate) Communication*  aka NVC Materials
- /Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life/ by Marshall Rosenberg
- /Nonviolent Communication Companion Workbook/ by Lucy Leu
  - Guides individuals and informal groups in studying Nonviolent
    Communication
- Lots of other books, recordings and videos

*** Workshops

The [[https://www1.hai.org][Human Awareness Institute]] Workshops.

[[https://www.landmarkworldwide.com][Landmark Worldwide]]'s workshops, especially
- Their full /Curriculum for Living/
      - The Landmark Forum
      - The Landmark Advanced Course
      - The Self-Expression and Leadership Program
            - do not miss this last part of the Curriculum!
- their /Communication/, /Wisdom/ and /Leadership/ curricula

*** Relevant Philosophical Traditions

Deep Rationality was very important to Early Philosophers. Some more recent
Philosophers have continued to explore Deep Rationality.

- [[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/socrates/][Socrates]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism][Stoicism]]
      - See [[https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2680][Meditations]] by the Emperor of Rome, [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Aurelius][Marcus Aurelius]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism][Existentialism]]
- [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology][Ontology]]

Warning: Approaching these philosophical subjects only intellectually will only
cultivate a narrow intellectual mode of being which, despite its value for
purely intellectual inquiry, fundamentally alienates us from being present to
the quality of our experience of being - which is highly ironic! One must
carefully balance these intellectual inquiries with experiential inquiries and
notice where and how they can assist with the quality of such.

*** Spiritual Communities and Traditions

Many spiritual communities have developed profound and effective tools for
accessing and practicing Deep Rationality. Alas, many of these traditions have
also collapsed some of their Deep Rationality distinctions with belief systems
and/or authoritarian practices over time. Collapsed distinctions can be
confusing, especially for those who have not practiced Deep Rationality outside
of such traditions.

Those of us who have a strong practice of Deep Rationality free of spiritual
traditions may discover that such traditions offer great treasure. Of especial
note are
- Many forms of Buddhism, especially Zen Buddhism
- Taoism
- Sufism, distinct from other forms of Islam

A good test for whether a system of Deep Rationality is free of excessive
attachments is to see if it is consistent with regular Rationality, Scientific
Inquiry and the values of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment][The European Enlightenment]], the sources of so much of
the freedom and awesomeness of the modern world.
